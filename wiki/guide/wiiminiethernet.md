# Connecting to the internet
As the Wii Mini has no Wi-Fi support, the only way to connect to the internet is using a USB Ethernet adapter. Luckily, this is very easy to do.

## What you'll need
- A USB drive formatted as FAT32 (the one you have used for previous tutorials will work)
- [Wii Mini Ethernet Enabler by Fullmetal5](/assets/files/wiiminiethernetenabler.zip)
- A way to transfer files to the USB drive
- A powered USB hub with either an Ethernet port built in or a separate USB Ethernet adapter.

## Process
First, plug your USB drive into whatever you are using to transfer the files onto it.

Extract the Ethernet Enabler app you downloaded earlier. Inside will be a folder named ``Wii Mini Ethernet Enable``. Transfer this folder to the ``apps`` folder on your USB drive.

Eject the USB drive

Insert your USB hub into the USB port into your console, and plug in the external power adapter.

Plug your USB drive into one of the ports on the USB hub.

If your hub has an Ethernet port built in, plug an Ethernet cable into it. If using a separate Ethernet adapter, plug it into one of the USB ports on the hub, and plug an Ethernet cable into it.

Turn on your Wii Mini, and navigate to the Homebrew Channel.

You should now see the ``Ethernet Enabler`` app. Highlight it, press ``A``, and then press ``Load``.

The app will now enable Ethernet on your console. When it finishes, exit back to the Homebrew Channel. In the bottom right, the internet symbol should briefly flash and then stay on. Your console is now connected to the internet!

Once you are done, you may choose where to proceed:
