By this point, you are now at the HackMii Installer scam screen. It looks something like this:

After about 30 seconds sitting on this screen, a small message will appear at the bottom telling you to press ``1`` to continue. Go ahead and do that.

Once you press ``1``, you will be greeted by the following screen, or something very similar. The only difference will be next to BootMii. It will either say ``Can be installed`` or ``Can only be installed as an IOS``. Take note of which one you see.

Press ``A`` to continue. On the next screen, choose ``Install The Homebrew Channel``.

Once it is completed, press ``A`` to return to the previous screen. 

## BootMii
**This section requires that you have an SD card formatted as FAT32 inserted in your Wii. If you do not, we highly recommend you get one, as BootMii is a very helpful tool. Otherwise, you may skip this section.**

BootMii is another homebrew program that is capable of backing up and restoring your Wii's NAND storage, among other things. 

Highlight the ``BootMii`` section, and press ``A`` to go into it. 

Choose the ``Prepare an SD Card`` option. Once it has completed, press ``A`` to return to the BootMii section.

Next, **if you have the option**, install ``BootMii as boot2``. Once it's done, press ``A`` to return to the BootMii section.

Install ``BootMii as an IOS``. Then, after it's complete, press ``A`` to return to the BootMii section.

You can now exit the BootMii section.

Finally, now you can exit the HackMii Installer by highlighting the ``Exit`` option and pressing ``A``. You will then be sent to the Homebrew Channel.


Once you have exited the HackMii Installer, you can now continue on to [installing Priiloader](/wiipriiloader)
