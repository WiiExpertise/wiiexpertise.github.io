# LetterBomb
In this guide you will execute the **LetterBomb** exploit to softmod your Wii.

## Procedure
First, insert the SD card you prepared previously into your Wii.

Then, turn on your Wii, and on the Wii Menu, press the Mail button in the bottom right.

In the message board, you may see a red envelope with a bomb in it under today's mail. If you see it, click on it. You should see some text, then after a few seconds, it should load the HackMii Installer Scam Warning screen.

If you don't see the envelope under today's mail, check up to a week in the past and a week in the future. The bomb should be there in that period. 

Once you see the HackMii Installer Scam Screen, you may continue to [the HackMii Installer](/wiihackmii)
