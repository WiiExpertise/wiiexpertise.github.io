Press ``A`` to continue. On the next screen, choose ``Install The Homebrew Channel``.

Once it is completed, press ``A`` to return to the previous screen. 

You can now exit the HackMii Installer by highlighting the ``Exit`` option and pressing ``A``. You will now be sent to the Homebrew Channel.

## BootMii
You may have seen a section in the HackMii Installer named BootMii.

BootMii is another homebrew program that is capable of backing up and restoring your Wii's NAND storage, among other things. 

On the Wii Mini, you technically can install BootMii as an IOS, however unless you have soldered on an SD card slot, you will be unable to use it. Therefore, we do not recommend you install it on your Wii Mini unless you have soldered on an SD card slot.


Once you have exited the HackMii Installer, you can now continue on to [installing Priiloader](/wiiminipriiloader)
