# System Menu Version
In order to find a suitable exploit, we need to know your Wii's current System Menu Version. Here, you will determine that.

## Procedure
Turn on your console, and make sure you are at the Wii Menu.

Next, press the Wii button at the bottom left of the Wii Menu.

In the screen that shows up next, press ``Wii Options``.

In the Wii Options screen, at the top right of the screen, you will see a number, a dot, another number, and a letter. The letter can be disregarded. The numbers and the dot are what you need to focus on.

If your System Menu version is ``4.3``, continue [here](/sdcardselection)

If your System Menu version is ``4.2`` or below, continue [here](/wiiupdate)
